Task0: O(1)
- The time complexity is constant because the algorithm just picks up the value at the fixed index.

Task1: O(n)
- The time complexity is linear because of the two for-loops dependent on the length of the data.

Task2: O(n)
- The time complexity is linear because of a data length dependent for-loop and max function. Both algorithms are linear time complexity.

Task3(A): O(n)
- The time complexity is lenear because of a for-loop dependent on the length of the data.

Task3(B): O(n logn)
- The time complexity is quasilinear determined by sorted() function which uses an algorithm called Timsort.

Task4: O(n logn)
- The time complexity is quasilinear determined by sorted() function which uses an algorithm called Timsort.
