# Problem 2: Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
## Reason
Recursive solution is used with the while loop. Search range becomes half with each loop iteration to achieve O(log n) efficiency.

## Efficiency
Time complexity is O(log n) as described above. The space efficiency is O(1). The algorithm doesn't use any data structure to store extra data and use constant size of memory for input data regardless of the input data size.
