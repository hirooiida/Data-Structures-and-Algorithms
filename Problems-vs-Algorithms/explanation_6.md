# Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
## Reason
The algorithm visits each item one time and update minimum and max values by comparing with temporary candidates.

## Efficiency
Time complexity is O(n). The algorithm always visit all the items one time. The space efficiency is O(1). It doesn't store extra data other than the input list.
