# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
## Reason
The sort is done by putting 0 and 2 in the right place while traversing each items. The problem setup is the same as a problem in the Udacity course so the same solution is used. 

## Efficiency
The time complexity is O(n) to traverse each item in the list. The space efficiency is O(n). The algorithm only uses the same size as the input list size.
