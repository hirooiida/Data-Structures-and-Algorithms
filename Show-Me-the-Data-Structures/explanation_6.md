# Reason
```set``` is used to store data and check if the value is added already because of its O(1) efficiency to access data.

# Efficiency
Time complexity is O(n) for both union and intersection because they need to run while loop for all the data in the lists step by step.

Space efficiency is O(n) for both of them. The worst case is to store all the values in two ```LinkedList```.
