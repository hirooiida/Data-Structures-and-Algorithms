# Reason
Recursion technique is used instead of ```for``` loop for code simplicity.

# Efficiency
Time complexity is O(n) because it checks all the paths one by one. Calculation steps can be linearly incleased according to the number of paths.

Space efficiency is O(n). ```output``` list is an only container which can store all the paths in worst case.
